Main Objective: To create a self-paced course generator that can aid learners to follow course content in their own time and space with proper guidance and rich interactions.

Main Research questions:
•	Watching lengthy lecture video's affect in learning.
•	Not having ability to talk to lecturer because of the isolation environment.
•	With workload having less time to create lecture notes.
•	Lack of a reliable mechanism to track each student's knowledge

Individual research question:
1.	Generate transcription and lecture notes automatically.
2.	AI-Based Lecture video segmentation.
3.	AI-BASED CHAT BOT.
4.	Automatically generate questions with evaluations and past question suggestion.

Individual Objectives;
1.	Generate transcription and lecture notes automatically.
•	To create and construct a lecture note / Short note in Sinhala English and Tamil.
•	Embed a subtitle method for videos in Sinhala English and Tamil.

2.	AI-Based Lecture video segmentation.
•	To remove noise in lecture video.
•	Segment lecture videos according to topic using low computational power.

3.	AI-BASED CHAT BOT.
•	To develop a software component to bridge the gap between the lecture and the student as well as to handle response delay to the students' questions based on the lecture contents.

4.	Automatically generate questions with evaluations and past question suggestion.
•	To develop a software component to track each student's knowledge and give support to their e-learning studies.
